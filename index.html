                <h2>AI Ecosystem Simulation</h2>
                <p>AI can be trained in many different ways. These AI bots are trained using natural selection, where only the fittest survive. The red bots simulate how a predator would act in the wild, while the green ones simulate how prey would behave. When a predator eats prey, that prey is removed from the gene pool, and the survivors that live long enough to reproduce will have their genes (their weights and biases) slightly altered. Similarly, if prey can evade the predator long enough for the predator to lose its energy, the predator will be removed from the gene pool. When a predator successfully catches prey, it creates a new predator with its genes slightly mutated.</p>
